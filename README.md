# Welcome to mivi_test

This is a test that need to go through if would like to join us at mivi

# What we're looking for

Simplicity and reliability is how we develop our software. With that in mind we'd love for you to build a very simple app for us.

# Technical Test
Using our public collection.json as a source of customer data we want you to create an app that consumes data from the collection and does the following:

1. Create an initial login screen that allows a customer to login (we don't want you to actually create an authentication layer, just validate the MSN credentials in the collection)
2. Display a simple welcome to mivi splash page
3. Transition through to a screen that shows the customer the following information:

  - information about their plan, also known as a subscription, remaining data balance of their subscription
  - information about the product that is related to the subscription, including the name and price of the product
  - any other information you think may be relevant to the customer

# Hints
Our collection.json is based on one of our public facing API's. It's built to the specification of http://jsonapi.org/ which is the standard for developing API's that we use here at mivi.

# Technical Guidance
1. Use the programming language and tooling of your choice, either *Swift4* Java or *kotlin*
2. Make your source code available on Github/Bitbucket (or the online repo of your choosing)
3. Try to avoid the use of frameworks (unless they're for testing)
4. Try not to spend more than 2-3 hours maximum. (We don't want you to lose a weekend over this!)
